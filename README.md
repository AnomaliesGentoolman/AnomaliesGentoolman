## My Favorite Repositories
+  **[Amnesia: The Dark Descent](https://github.com/TiManGames/AmnesiaTheDarkDescent)**
    +  **[Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs](https://github.com/FrictionalGames/AmnesiaAMachineForPigs)**
    
These games are actually one of the best open source and horror games at all after the SCP: Containment Breach! but the assets are paid. (i bought tdd and amfp because of this)

+  **[Microsoft Powertoys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)**

Very useful for me, i dont know about you but i like that.

+  **[Cheat Engine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine)**

It gives alot of ability to hack with the executables.
